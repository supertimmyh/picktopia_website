### 1. Set Up Your Court Reserve Account
To get started, you'll need a Court Reserve account linked to our club. This will be your portal for everything our facility offers. You can begin by downloading the Court Reserve app or visiting their website and searching for our club's name.

### 2. Complete the Digital Waiver
Your safety is important to us. Before you play, please fill out our quick digital waiver, which you can find in your Court Reserve account. It only takes a moment.

**Pro Tip:** We recommend completing the waiver before you book your first court to streamline the process!
