  We're officially launching our brand new 8-Week Flexible League System! This
  new format directly solves the headache of time conflicts and large, upfront
  fees.


  Here are the 6 Most Important Highlights of our new leagues:




  1. Total Scheduling Flexibility: Play When You Want! 

  	•	No Fixed Schedule: Throw out the old fixed day and time! Your league could offers multiple sessions per week.

  	•	Drop-In: Simply check the app and register for the single session that works with your schedule that week.

  2. Pay-Per-Session & Member Value! 

  	•	Pay-As-You-Play: The league fee is charged per session attended (Punch Cards accepted!). You only pay for the pickleball you play, eliminating financial stress for missed weeks.

  	•	Member Perk: All-Access and Core Flex Members play the Club, Challenger, and Pinnacle Leagues for FREE!

  	•	50% Off Afternoon League: Play during non-peak hours and save big on your session fees!

  3. Guaranteed Competitive Balance: 4 Tiers! 

  	•	We use four distinct tiers—Launchpad (2.5-3.0), Club (3.0-3.5), Challenger (3.5-4.0), and Pinnacle (4.0+)—to guarantee you always play with and against players of a matching skill level.

  4. Launchpad League: Learn While You Play! 

  	•	The Launchpad League (2.5-3.0) with coaching is the perfect transition from lessons, as every session includes on-court instruction and strategy guidance from a coach to help you level up fast!

  5. Climb the Ladder: Mid-Season Promotion! 

  	•	By Week 4, the top three players in your standing can request approval to be promoted to the next-highest league tier, giving you a clear path for rapid progression.

  6. Easy Setup & Player Accountability! 

  	•	We use the efficient "Shootout" format to arrange dynamic doubles matches. Players are responsible for entering match results into the app and verifying their standing before each session, ensuring immediate and accurate court arrangement.
