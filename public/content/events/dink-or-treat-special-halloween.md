  **ðŸ’€ GLOW-IN-THE-DARK DINK ðŸ’€**Step into a blackout court, lit only by
  backlights! All lines and the pickleballs will glow. Test your skills at dink
  accuracy to earn Halloween candies (Life Tokens) and raffle tickets! Wear your
  brightest neon or white attire and become part of the glowing spectacle!


  **ðŸ”ª FRIGHT NIGHT KNOCKOUT ðŸ”ª**Enter a sudden death single-elimination bracket where every match is high-stakes! Play to 7 "Life Tokens" (Halloween candies) â€“ no "win by 2" here, just pure sudden death! If you hit a 6-6 tie, get ready for "The Ultimate Trick": draw a "Trick Card" imposing a hilarious penalty and use a "Haunted Paddle" for the final rally! The last team standing is crowned "Dink or Treat Champions" and takes the grand prize!
