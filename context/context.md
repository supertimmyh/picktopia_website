### **🏆 The Prestige Seeding System**

To honor the consistent performers in the league, the tournament utilizes a special seeding system at the start of the Round Robin stage.

#### **1\. Identifying Top Seeds**

Before the draw, the **Top Male Player** and the **Top Female Player** in each tier are designated as the **Prestigious Seeds** based on their performance in the preceding league season.

* **Criteria:** Seeds are determined by the **highest win percentage** in the league (minimum 5 matches played), with tie-breakers going to head-to-head records and total games won.

#### **2\. Round Robin Division Draw**

The seeds are used to guarantee balanced and exciting preliminary divisions:

* **Seed Placement:**  
  * The **Top Male Seed** is automatically placed in **Division A**.  
  * The **Top Female Seed** is automatically placed in **Division B**.  
* The remaining players are then drawn randomly into the open spots across all divisions. This guarantees the two highest-performing players are placed in separate divisions, setting up a potential exciting clash in the playoff finals\!

### **Game Format & Rules**

#### **Round Robin Stage**

* **Matches:** Each player plays everyone else in their assigned division (3 matches minimum).  
* **Scoring:** Matches are typically one **Pro Set to 8 games** (with a 7-point tie-break at 7-7), or a designated number of short sets (e.g., Best 2 out of 3 short sets to 4, no-ad). *(You must specify the exact scoring format here).*  
* **Advancement:** The top **X players** (e.g., top 2\) from each division advance to the Single Elimination Playoff bracket. Advancement ties are broken by: 1\) Head-to-Head result, 2\) Highest game win percentage, 3\) Coin flip.

#### **Single Elimination Playoff Stage**

* **Playoff Seeding:** All advancing players are **re-seeded 1 through 8** (or however large your bracket is) based on their **overall performance** in the Round Robin stage (Win % and Game Differential).  
* **Matches:** Standard best **2 out of 3 sets** (with a 10-point tie-break in lieu of a 3rd set, if time is a factor). The highest-seeded player always plays the lowest-seeded player in the first round (e.g., Seed \#1 vs. Seed \#8).
