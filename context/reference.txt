I’ve had the pleasure of training with HEad Coach Jose, and I can confidently say his coaching has made a significant impact on my game. He brings an exceptional level of detail and precision to every session, breaking down techniques for serves, returns, drop shots, and more with clear, actionable guidance. His personalized analysis of both my technique and strategy provided invaluable insights that helped me grow as a player. What sets him apart is his patience and commitment to helping you improve—he meets you where you are and builds from there. I highly recommend him to anyone looking to elevate their pickleball skills.
