# Implementation Plan: Tournaments Page

This document outlines the steps to create a new "Tournaments" page to display prize pool information, managed via the CMS.

## 1. CMS Configuration

**File:** `public/admin/config.yml`

**Action:** Add a new collection for "Tournaments".

**Details:**
The new collection will have the following fields:
- `name`: "tournaments"
- `label`: "Tournaments"
- `folder`: "public/content/tournaments"
- `create`: true
- `slug`: "{{slug}}"
- `fields`:
  - `title`: Tournament Name (String)
  - `enabled`: Publication status (Boolean)
  - `tournament_date`: Date of the tournament (Datetime)
  - `prize_pool`: Total prize pool for the tournament (Number)
  - `annual_pool_contribution`: Amount contributed to the annual prize pool (Number)
  - `admin_fee`: Administrative fee portion (Number)
  - `description`: Detailed information about the tournament (Markdown)
  - `image`: A promotional image for the tournament (Image)

## 2. Create Placeholder Content

**Action:** Create an initial markdown file for a sample tournament to facilitate development.

**Steps:**
1. Create a new directory: `public/content/tournaments/`
2. Create a new file: `public/content/tournaments/inaugural-cash-tournament.md`
3. Populate the file with placeholder content matching the fields defined in `config.yml`.

## 3. Automation and Manifest Generation

**File:** `.github/workflows/update-manifests.yml`
**Action:** Add the new tournaments collection to the GitHub Action workflow to enable automatic manifest generation.
**Change:** Add `'public/content/tournaments/**'` to the `paths` list.

**File:** `scripts/generate-manifests.js`
**Action:** Add logic to generate a `manifest.json` file for the `tournaments` collection.
**Change:** Replicate the logic used for existing collections (like events or locations) for the new `tournaments` directory.

## 4. Frontend Development

**File (New):** `src/pages/TournamentsPage.jsx`
**Action:** Create a new React component to serve as the main page for tournaments.
**Logic:**
- Fetch the list of tournament slugs from `/content/tournaments/manifest.json`.
- Loop through the slugs and load the content for each tournament using the `loadContent` utility.
- Store the tournament data in the component's state.
- Render a list of `TournamentCard` components.

**File (New):** `src/components/TournamentCard.jsx`
**Action:** Create a reusable component to display the details of a single tournament.
**Props:** This component will accept tournament data (title, prize pool, dates, etc.) as props.
**Content:** It will display the tournament information in a structured and visually appealing format, including the prize pool breakdown.

## 5. Navigation and Routing

**File:** `src/App.jsx`
**Action:** Add a new route to handle the "Tournaments" page.
**Change:** In the main switch statement for page rendering, add a new `case` for 'tournaments' that renders the `TournamentsPage` component.

**File:** `src/data/data.js`
**Action:** Add a navigation link to the new page.
**Change:** Add a new object to the `navLinks` array. Example: `{ name: 'Tournaments', path: 'tournaments' }`.

## 6. Asset Management

**Action:** Create a dedicated folder for tournament-related images.
**Path:** `public/images/tournaments/`
**Usage:** When adding tournament images through the CMS, they should be saved to this directory to maintain project structure.
