  This isn't your average tournament. Forget individual wins—we're all about
  TEAM VICTORY! Get ready for a weekend of strategy, camaraderie, and a format
  where every single point counts.


  #### HOW IT WORKS: Team Aggregate Scoring!


  In every matchup, your team's total score is the sum of FOUR games. Every dink, drive, and drop shot adds to your tournament-long leaderboard score!


  ✅ FORM YOUR SQUAD: 4-person teams (1 Female, 3 Male)

  ✅ BATTLE IT OUT: 1 Men's & 2 Mixed Doubles games per matchup.

  ✅ CLIMB THE RANKS: The top 2 teams in each DUPR-capped division advance.

  ✅ GO FOR GOLD: Compete for the championship in the Gold Medal Final! 🥇


  This is the ultimate event for players who love strategy and the thrill of team competition. Are you in?
